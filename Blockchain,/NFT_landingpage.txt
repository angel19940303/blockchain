(1.In a magical world where apes ruled the metaverse, a magical thousand-year-old tree sprouted cute baby apes. A flock of storks were the loyal companions of the thousand-year-old tree. One sunny day, a total of 9999 baby apes were born. Storks followed their inner call and delivered all the baby apes. The families were so grateful and elated that they wanted even more baby apes. All were delivered and all lived a joyous life with their parents.)
